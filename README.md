# Password-Manager

#languages used: Python

# About the project
This project was developped over the summer of 2023 to explore more of MongoDB and develop a password manager. 

This project allowed me to learn more about MongoDB and experiement with encryption. 

I intend to fortify the encryption process in this project once I get some more free time.

# How To run
1. Navigate to terminal
2. Change the directory to the project directory
3. Compile and run the code using the command below:
-     python3 passwordManager.py

- Note: You need to have MongoDB installed to be able to run the project. You can also additionally install Compass to visualise the database.
